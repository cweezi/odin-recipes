    <p>Chicken Inasal is a grilled chicken dish and one of the well known Ilonggo dishes. This is done by marinating chicken pieces in a unique blend of spices and grilling them until done. With the addition of a distinctive basting sauce that makes it so so succulent and satisfying you will never go back to your old way of grilling chicken.</p>
